# PROJECT
For this project I am creating a travel journal. Tne reponsive menu includes sections for "About Me," "Travels" and "Contact." Each section can be clicked and it will navigate to that section on the webpage. Once on the "Travels" section the user can click the button for each destination. Each destination will take you to a photo album of photos taken by me and each destination. 

The purpose of the website will be to give me a space to keep travel memories/photos easily accessible in one place.

•	Feature 2: Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover - The buttons change color when you hover over them. 
•	Feature 3:
